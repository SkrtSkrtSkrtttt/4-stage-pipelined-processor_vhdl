# 4-stage-pipelined-processor_vhdl
A 4-stage pipelined multimedia processor implemented in VHDL with custom C++ assembler support. Designed as a final project for  computer arch

This project implements a four-stage pipelined multimedia processing unit (PMU) in VHDL, capable of executing custom instruction formats (R3, R4, and I-type). It includes a testbench for simulation, hazard resolution via forwarding logic, and a custom-built C++ assembler to convert MIPS-style assembly into binary machine code. The project was developed for ESE 345: Computer Architecture at Stony Brook University and showcases advanced pipelined processor design and simulation techniques.
